## Overview
This task was developed by Me and it was a challenging task.
In this project as a user, you wil be able to see all the countries available. You can search by name and also filter by regions

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process
  The task is a responsive web application that takes a mobile first responsiveness approach.
  I used certain packages such as React-Router Dom for routing, Stled Components for style and Material Ui and made sure the codes are in differenct
  components for easy readability. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
